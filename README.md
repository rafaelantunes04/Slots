End product should be a site that has accounts and you can play slots.

To start you must go to cmd and write 'node serverRegister.js 'must be in folder using cd <folder location>
  
  At the time im writing this (27/01/2023) only the register page is working, in the mysqlmodule you have to change the credentials to your mysql database to       test and you need to have a table that has id / name / password / money in this order.
  
  Feel free to ask something or to do branches.
